# Basic Setup

Welcome! To set up this project you need to first install [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
You can find install instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once installed you should now be able to run `node -v` from your console and get output like so:

```
$ node -v
v8.11.1
```

## How to run the app
To simplify the process we've pushed all the required dependencies so no need to install them. Simply open your terminal/command line and run `node main.js`. If the app successfully starts you will see `Buggy app listening on port 3000!`.

Once up and running just open your favourite browser and visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). 
You will be greeted with a `Hello` response.

## Expected Output 
The app was created to return a response of `Hello Joe Bloggs`. 

## Making changes 
If you make a change you must rerun `node main.js` to reflect the change.
